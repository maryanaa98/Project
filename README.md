Mini Project

## Background

Your client has launched a pop-up caf√© in a busy business district. They
are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding
offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders.


## Client requirements as a user I want to: 
* Create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list 
* View all products, couriers, or orders 
* Update the status of an order 
* persist my data
* STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier

## How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
The app is designed to allow the client to view, change, and delete items, couriers, and incoming orders. CSV files are used to store the data. The significance of sticking to the stated specification became early in the project. Since the client's specifications did not let us to provide any further functionalities


## How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
To guarantee that the project's criteria were properly met, I matched the defined requirements with the client's demands while ensuring the functionality of the app. This project demonstrated how critical is it to adhere strictly to the client's specification


## If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?
Including unit testing into my project. The advantage of unit tests is that they isolate a function, class, method and only test that specific code. Individual components of higher quality contribute to overall system robustness.

## What did you most enjoy implementing?
I enjoyed implementing the core functionalities.
